# What's Pro?

Pro is the goal. Pro is your first step into the work place. Pro
courses are managed as if you have been hired to create, manage,
develop, and complete a project for the course. This is where stuff
gets real and can be quite a paradigm shift, but don't worry, you
get a chance to make honest mistakes other professionals would be
fired for in a safe environment. Better you learn those real lessons
now rather than on the job. This is the main goal of Pro—even more
than increasing your technical skills.

## Perks

**All You Can Eat:** Being in Pro means you can come here *any time
we are open* to work on your Pro project. You can also officially
enroll in any other course we offer that has seats remaining (after
the early enrollment deadline). Think of it like an all-you-can-eat
buffet, just make sure to not take more than you can eat on your
plate. You will still be required—above all—to deliver on your Pro
project. The weekly class you regularly attend is called your
*anchor* class.

**Startup Feel:** The atmosphere and culture of Pro classes is also
very laid-back, sort of a Google-meets-Berkley atmosphere.  We allow
a higher degree of socializing, randomness, and creativity during
classes because this greases the wheels of innovation and idea
generation.  We also assume you have been working on your projects
from home and now is your chance to ask peers, instructors, and
mentors for their input in person.

**Preferred Recommendations:** Pros always get our best,
priority recommendations when organizations and recruiters contact us
for employment and internship opportunities.

**Resources, Resources, Resources:** We've invested thousands of
dollars in every location mostly to be used by our Pro students.
Whether it is a professional soldering station, full Solid Works or
Adobe Cloud license, hundreds of Unity assets, an organizational Apple
developer ID, dozens of Digital Ocean server instances, or something
we don't have that you can request as a part of your project plan,
say, like a $2000 professional video camera.

**Smaller Class Sizes:** Pro *anchor* classes are limited to eight
students each with an instructor with more than five years of
experience working as a technologist—primarily involving programming.
You don't get that kind of contact and experience in most schools and
courses.

**VIP Tech Conference Status:** Our Pro students sit front row of our
local technology conferences and forums where we invite leading tech
professionals to share insight, wisdom and tech know-how with the
community at large.

**Teach Workshops:** Pro students are invited to teach workshops on
their favorite topics for fun and/or profit. Our teacher assistants
are almost always also in the Pro program.

**Internal Hires:** For any position that does not require 5+ career
technology experience we hire exclusively from among our Pro students.
No one knows our organization better. This include preferred status to
Pros and former Pros who wish to start-up their own locations.

## Expectations

Pro carries a higher standard of personal responsibility, independence,
and professionalism than other courses. In fact, the primary goal
of Pro is to help instill professional habits and build profiles
and project work to demonstrate what you know to others.

**Stay Informed:** It is your responsibility to know about every
deadline and everything that is happening in class. This includes
checking your school's web site and your course chat room. *It is
your responsibility to ask questions when you are not sure of
something.* 

**Communicate for Yourself:** Unless you are incapacitated and
unable to speak or type your parents, grandparents, guardian, sister,
brother, uncle, or friend ***cannot communicate for you.*** Even
if you worked for Walmart you could not have your parents call in
sick for you (no really, they won't even take the call). Get in the
habit of managing your own life and responsibilities.

**Keep Current:** In the professional world you are expected to keep
your tech skills current and relevant—even if you are assigned for
great lengths of time to work on something that does not involve those
skills. Those who let their skills become dull end up cut and
unemployed, or worse, stuck in a horrible job they hate. Often
organizations will tell you they want to invest in you and help you
learn, but often it ends up being only you that can make sure that
happens.

The same is true for Pro here. All certifications you earned to get
yourself into Pro must be maintained. Most have a maximum two-year
expiration based on the pace of technology change we (and you) have
to keep up with here. If you fail to maintain your required
certifications you will lose your Pro invite, but can always get it
back after you do what it takes to re-certify.

**Manage Makeups:** It is your responsibility to handle any make
ups needed and to inform your instructor that you will not be
attending class and which time you need to come instead to get
questions answered, use the stuff here, and other things needed to
make progress on your project.

**Stay Busy:** It is your responsibility to keep busy on your project
by making adjustments as necessary if you think you have finished
too early. On the job finishing early is usually not rewarded and
seen as a warning sign that you did not do a good job meeting the
requirements.

**Know Your Limits:** It is your responsibility to pick a project
you feel you can complete within the time frame for the course and
to adjust the scope of the project as necessary to having something
finished by the end of the course. For example, creating a new game
in a language you have never programmed before might be more than
you want to commit to.

**Know What's Appropriate:** It is your responsibility to know what
professional behavior is, learn what it is, and act accordingly.
There is no "but I didn't know that was inappropriate" excuse to
be had. If you are not sure ask your instructor or a trusted adult
(who actually understands what professional behavior is).

There are many other expectations but these cover the essentials. It
is your responsibility to ask if there is any question at all.

## Three Strikes

Any of the following will get you a strike. Three strikes and you
immediately lose your Pro invite for at least one semester and will
have to begin attending whatever other courses are available—*no refunds*:

* Missing any deadline
* Using not suitable-for-work language, videos, etc.
* Pranks or bullying of any kind, even in fun
* Disrespect for the instructor, mentors, or other students 
* Exceptionally distracting students during class

If any of these happens there won't be a lot of conversation about
it, you'll just get taken aside and informed and your parents will
be contacted. The strike will appear as an issue on your private
project documentation repo (this one).

There, enough about that.

## Project Completion

**You must complete your project during the course or you will lose
your Pro invite for the next course.** How will you know you are
complete:

* Does it feel polished
* Would you feel comfortable linking to it from your resume or
  LinkedIn?
* How do you feel about showing it to your friend, parents, or boss?

Sometimes you may have gotten the scope of your project wrong at the
start and need some help from your instructor to adjust the amount
of work for your project. This is normal, but work hard to set
realistic objectives.
