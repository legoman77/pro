# Professional Incubator Program

Welcome to the Pro program and congrats on earning your way here.
Here's what you need to do next:

1. Read, understand, and [sign](signing.md) [*What's Pro?*](whats-pro.md)
2. Check the [schedule](schedule.md) to know what is next

***It is important that you keep this Pro documentation repo up to
date since this is how you and your instructor keep track of and
communicate about your project much like most work places would
require.***
