## To Instructors

**Time and Scheduling:** Unlike other courses this course depends on
the student managing their own time inside and outside of class.
Indeed, that is one major point of the class. Students generally meet
for one 90-minute class a week for 16 weeks. Class time is used mostly
for students to connect with peers and get help from others to
overcome any blockers. Every class begins with an Agile scrum session.

**Age:** The content is designed with students of any age but
generally 12 and above.

**Rubrics:** The rubric for this course is very specifically the
outcome of each students project and their ability to maintain the
[expectations of Pro](whats-pro.md#expectations) throughout the
course without any strikes.

**Resources and Requirements:** These will vary dramatically based
on the planned projects of the students. Depending on the resources of
your institution you can obtain specific resources for each student
to complete their project. This is one of the main attractions of the
Pro program for students. For example, you may have maker-space tools
such as soldering guns, extra Raspberry Pis and such or a Solidworks
license for students to use while at school.

Usually students will already be familiar with requirements of other
courses leading up to Pro, usually they will including programming
language fundamentals courses.

**GitHub Classroom:** This course is setup to work well with
`classroom.github.com` and we encourage it. Because everything in
this repo is released to the public domain you should have no problem
setting up an "assignment" as follows for use with your own students.

Using GitHub classroom with private repos allows students to work
without the worry of being scrutinized by peers and the public.

**Follow Up Possibilities:** This course is designed to prepare
students to enter the work force or higher education. Pro is
frequently repeated until students make the move.
