# Final Review

You need to have everything in your project and any updates you
wish to have considered done **within one week of your last class**.
Any changes made to this Pro documentation repo after
that date and time will not be considered. [Some instructors may even
block your write access to this repo after that time.]

Your instructor will provide one final review of your project after
that time and create an issue assigned to you containing any final
comments and feedback including notification that you have maintained
your Pro invite qualifications.
