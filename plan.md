# Project Plan

*Text in italics is for explanation and can be deleted.  
Replace this text here with a general overview and idea of your
project in detail, about a paragraph.*

## Objectives

*Here is where you write what you personally want to get from Pro
this semester. Start them with verbs if it helps ( Learn Go HTML
template language) and not external (i.e. I want to sell 20 apps). You
can delete this italics text after you read it.*

* *my objective*
* *another objective*
* *etc*

## Reference Links

*Most Pro projects will have one or more other repos or even an
organization to contain the actual source code. Link to it here.
The idea is that the projects created in Pro could live on their
own without being associated with this course.*
