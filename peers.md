# Pro Project Peers

There are no TAs for Pro. You are each others' TAs. It is important
that you contribute in a positive way to each others projects and
learning. Following your Pro peers to get you started.

## Follow Peers

To follow, first learn their GitHub names in class or from the web
site. Then go to their GitHub profile and click the *Follow* button.
You may wish to follow Pro peers from other classes as well. Classes
are just a regular time to meet weekly, consider yourself part of
a larger group than just the peers you meet with on a particular class
day. You can also connect regularly with your peers in the `#pro`
chat channel.

## Peer Review

*Peer Review* is an ongoing informal assignment to help you get
ideas and share your own.

Also, if you have feedback or a suggestion about this Pro course in
general please open an issue on our version of the starter repo
so we can have a record of your ideas. As usual, the students are the
best source of ideas on how to make stuff better.
